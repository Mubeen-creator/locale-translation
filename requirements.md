✅ What You Actually Need to Do

Understand the existing preload logic:
How does it bundle everything into one file?
How does lazy loading work per route?
Integrate translations into that system:
Keep ONE file per compiled section.
When a user visits a route for the first time:
Lazy load that section (already working).
Load its translation bundle along with it.
No new preload logic should be added—just enhance the existing one.
Test with console log:
When preloading, the console should show it loads one file only.
Verify translations are included.
You only need to inject translations into the existing single-file compiled preload system.
