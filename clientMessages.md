In the following I will give you the messages of client, I have done work wrong first time know I need to correct it.
messages:
You have deeply misunderstood.
Let me say this once and once only to give you a chance. 
1. Delete everything you hae done so far - all logic is broken and gone
2. Go back to correct version, start again 
3. Logic is: we compile ALL ine ONE section. Again, when compiled, everything is bundled into ONE FILE. ONE FILE!!! 
4. This one file should now have the transaltions in it. 
5. When you watch console log preloading section, it will be loading.... 1 FILE., ONLY ONE FILE.
6. I have video demo of this working with previous version. 
7. Your error is your AI has changed this to preload sinular files. This is wrong. We are preloading fully compiledf sections - and this logic is done and already working. We only need to add translation into this. 
8. Please do NOT use Ai to broadly change / write - this is what happens. 
9. Please be sure you understand
10. Just know, the logic is already there. You only need to add ttransaltions to it.
11. I suggest you upload the existing zip and ask it to explain how preload of bundled section works and what you need to do to integrate transations per section per section which is in route config while lazy loading only current route transaltion if first time visit.
12. Upload to chatgpt whole zip with the + icon ou can do that these days
